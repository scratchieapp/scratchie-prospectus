# Integration Guide for the Risks Section

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the new Risks section into your refactored Scratchie Prospectus app.

## Step 1: Add the Risks Data

Import the risks data into your main `ScratchieProspectus.jsx` file:

```jsx
// Add these imports at the top with your other imports
import { 
  AlertTriangle, Activity, TrendingDown, Users, User, 
  Briefcase, Shield, Lock, Globe, FileText, DollarSign 
} from 'lucide-react';

// Then add the risksData constant alongside your other data constants
const risksData = [
  {
    title: "Product & Market Risks",
    bgColor: "bg-blue-100",
    icon: <Activity className="h-6 w-6 text-blue-600" />,
    risks: [
      {
        title: "Product Functionality Issues",
        description: "Technical problems could impact user experience and adoption.",
        mitigation: "Rigorous QA process and fast iteration cycles based on user feedback.",
        likelihood: 2,
        impact: 4
      },
      // ... other risks from the RisksData.js file
    ]
  },
  // ... other risk categories from the RisksData.js file
];
```

## Step 2: Create the RisksSection Component

Create a new file called `RisksSection.jsx` in your components directory and paste the contents of the RisksSection.jsx artifact.

## Step 3: Update Navigation Tabs

Modify your navigation tabs to include the Risks section:

```jsx
{/* Navigation Tabs */}
<div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center mb-8 space-x-2">
  <button
    onClick={() => setActiveTab('overview')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md ${activeTab === 'overview' ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white' : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-700'} mb-2`}
  >
    Overview
  </button>
  {/* Your other existing tabs */}
  <button
    onClick={() => setActiveTab('risks')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md ${activeTab === 'risks' ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white' : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-700'} mb-2`}
  >
    Risks
  </button>
</div>
```

## Step 4: Add the Risks Section to Conditional Rendering

Add the RisksSection component to your conditional rendering logic:

```jsx
{/* Content Sections */}
{activeTab === 'overview' && (
  <OverviewSection 
    revenueData={revenueData} 
    userGrowthData={userGrowthData}
    breakdownData2026={breakdownData2026}
  />
)}
{/* Your other existing sections */}
{activeTab === 'risks' && (
  <RisksSection risksData={risksData} />
)}
```

## Step 5: Import the RisksSection Component

Add the import for the RisksSection component at the top of your main file:

```jsx
import RisksSection from './RisksSection';
```

## Step 6: Pass Data to the Main Component

If your refactored app is using a centralized data approach, make sure to pass the risksData to any components that need it.

## Final Notes for Integration

1. **Styling Consistency**: The Risks section follows the same styling patterns as the other sections for visual consistency.

2. **Risk Customization**: Feel free to adjust the likelihood and impact numbers in the risksData to reflect your own assessment of these risks.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The design is already responsive, with the grid switching to a single column on smaller screens.

4. **Adding More Risks**: If you think of additional risks specific to your business, you can easily add them to the relevant category in the risksData array.

5. **Icon Imports**: Make sure all the Lucide React icons used in both components are properly imported in your project.

Your Cursor IDE agent should be able to help you integrate this code smoothly into your existing structure. The components are designed to fit seamlessly with the code you've already provided.
